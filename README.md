Volunteer Platform


# What do we do?

Our solution offers sustainable, fundraising and communication platform connecting volunteers and non-profit organisations. By being operated in form of a non-profit organisation, we will always keep up living up to our promise: non-profits before profit. 

# How do we do it?

We build an open source platform together, by volunteers, where this vision can come true.
We believe that technology is a great tool in our hands, it can serve our goal, the synergy of communities.
